            Pedagogy</h6>
        <div id="hidePedagogy" class="researchText" style="display: none;">
        <p>Pedagogy refers to the art and science of teaching and learning. 
            The name derives from the Greek word “paidagogos”, which is a combination of the words “paidos”, 
            meaning child, and “agogos”, meaning leader.</p>
        <p>Pedagogy emphasises the importance of ongoing discussions between teachers and students throughout 
            the stages of learning, and promotes the development of effective methods such as technology-based 
            learning, in order to adapt instruction to individual student ability. Differentiated instruction, 
            D.I., is the method of tailoring teaching techniques to a student's individual needs and learning 
            styles, counteracting the negative aspects of solo-learning. D.I. also promotes the benefits of 
            gamifying education, especially for younger learners, which evokes transfer learning - the method 
            of applying learned skills to solve a new and unrelated problem, resulting in new skills being 
            developed.</p>
            <p>Pedagogy as a whole encourages self-development, journaling, and active reflection as a means 
                of positive and productive learning. Teachers must engage with students, having meaningful 
                conversations in order to kickstart critical thinking. This leads to the authentic understanding 
                of information rather than a general surface knowledge. Overall, pedagogy highlights that the 
                process of teaching and learning should be a collaborative process between teacher and student.</p>

            Phonics</h6>
        <div id="hidePhonics" class="researchText" style="display: none;">
            <p>Phonics refers to the method of teaching people how to read and write through helping them to 
                recognize and use the different sounds that classify one word from another.</p>
            <p>Phonics in music instruction explores the strong correlation between a student's ability to read 
                text and their proficiency in music reading and fluency. It is suggested that early exposure to 
                music and pitch perception is directly related to reading capability in children. Theories based 
                on connecting pitch discrimination and aural recognition are used by music therapists when 
                designing activities, and it is proposed that music and academic success, particularly in reading 
                music while performing, are strongly interconnected. The parallels between decoding in reading text 
                and reading music both involve breaking down information into symbols or individual elements.</p>
            <p>Phonemes, crucial for sounding out words, are found to be transferrable between reading and music, 
                and research suggests that the neural encoding areas in the brain for processing sequences, such 
                as sentences and written music, overlap. The shared neural area is believed to contribute to the 
                correlation between musical ability and literacy related skills, with learning musical skills, 
                especially reading music, showing to positively impact brain structure and enhance overall learning 
                ability. It is suggested that there are common learning and processing methods between reading music 
                and text, with children who excel in one often demonstrate increased skills in the other.</p>
            <p>Music can be a powerful motivational tool for a positive learning experience, particularly in the 
                context of learning to read.</p>

                one-sided narration from the teacher only leads to memorization from the student, in which they are
                trained to receive, memorize, and merely repeat. The teacher must create a conversation rather
                than a narration, for which the student can return questions, inventions and re-inventions,
                and develop authentic thoughts and understanding of the material. Problem-posing education creates

                in cognition. In other words, teaching which requires critical thinking will generate critical
                thinking. An individual's own understanding of material will create new concepts surrounding it,

            <p>"Others have theorized that pitch discrimination, which develops early in the child's life, 
                contributes to auditory discrimination and aural recognition of phonetic information

            <p>"A long-enduring theory has been that learning to read music notation enhances verbal 
                reading ability. The many correlational studies showing the relationship between academic 
                achievement and school participation in music performance requiring notation reading 
                are often cited as evidence of this"</p>

            <p>"Andrews (1997) focused on making comparisons and contrasts, understanding text organization, 
                and identifying musical form using music activities incorporating reading, listening,

            <p class="summary">Summary:</p>
            <p>A direct link between pitch discrimination and aural recognition has been theorised, 
                leading to music therapists designing music activities to facilitate reading tuition, 
                particularly aimed at children with special educational needs. Another theory suggests 
                that musical practice and academic success are linked, particularly within reading music 
                while performing. Connecting letters and notes is a strong method of teaching keyboard 
                notes. Academic instruction can be intertwined with music, e.g., learning text 
                organisation through musical activities - a blended learning curriculum.</p>

            <p>"Art professor Elliot Eisner eloquently writes, "Children who have not learned how

                to reconstruct from sensory exploration of the environment""</p>
            <p>"Instruction in music can be a particularly rich source of support for achieving reading 
                literacy. Most basic skills used in text reading or decoding (i.e., the breaking of the 
                visual code of symbols into sounds) find parallels in music reading"</p>
            <p>On phonemic awareness - "At the decoding level, students look at a word like "dog" and 
                sound out the three phonemes (the sounds of the word) with their mouth: /d/-/o/-/g/. 
                Students with fluent skills can sound out complex words found in science, math, and 
                foreign languages via phonemes"</p>

            <p>It is suggested that music and the arts evoke curiosity and sensory exploration in children.
                There are direct parallels between decoding when reading text and reading music - breaking 
                down information into symbols or individuals. Phonemes, the sounds of a word, are highly 
                transferrable in reading, allowing one to sound out complex words (or pieces of music).
                Children receiving music tuition are able to pair symbols with a corresponding musical 
                element or sound naturally. Fluency in music reading occurs when notated music can be 
                analysed  and paired with musical elements and their overall effect. As in reading, music 
                sight reading concerns instant recognition of notes via a glance.
                Decoding skills allow for the recognition and documenting of note pitch, rhythm, and 
                melodic patterns as it is being heard.</p>

            <p>"Research suggests that musical training assists the encoding of speech (Nan et al., 2018; 
                Patel, 2011)"</p>
            <p>"There is also evidence that language and music share a common neural encoding in the Broca's 
                area of the brain in the ability to process structured sequences (Chiang et al., 2018)"</p>
                <footer class="blockquote-footer">p. 334</footer>
            <p>"There is evidence that there is some overlap, for example, in processing rhythmic structure, 
                rhyme awareness, or in speech perception (Corriveau et al., 2010; Liu et  al., 2010; Moreno 
                & Besson, 2006)"</p>
            <p>"In a study looking at the processing of speech regularities in children aged 8-13, reading 
                and music aptitude had positive correlations with auditory working memory (Strait et al., 2011)"</p>
            <p>"There is a direct relationship between musical skill and literacy related skills as a result of 
                having a common encoding mechanism"</p>
            <p>"Research evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) indicates that there are 
                indeed changes in brain structure that result from musical training that may lead to an improved 
                capacity to learn (Ragert et al., 2004; Stewart, 2003, 2008)"</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">p. 335</footer>
            <p>"The reading of musical notation has indeed been found to show a positive impact on brain function 
                (Stewart & Williamon, 2008; Stewart et  al., 2003). Here, again there is the likelihood of a shared 
                mechanism. Reading music requires perception of, and encoding of, visual symbols followed by the 
                action of producing a musical response. Language reading requires perception of, and encoding of, 
                visual symbols followed by the action of producing a verbal response"</p>
            <p>"Reading music shares similarities with reading text; the visual appearance of symbols on a stave 
                bear as little resemblance to their musical sounds as letters do to spoken sounds"</p>
            <p>"In Stewart's study (2003) after only 3 months of training, novice pianists had started to process 
                musical notation automatically. Scans revealed that particular areas of the brain were activated 
                whilst reading musical notation that could not be detected in the control group. Simply seeing 
                musical notes after a short period of time set in motion a sequence of neural events related to 
                the learned musical response (Stewart & Williamon, 2008)"</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">p. 336</footer>
            <p class="summary">Summary:</p>
            <p>Evidence suggests that language and music utilise the same neural encoding area of the brain in relation 
                to processing sequences, i.e., sentences, bars of written music. It is suggested that rhythm processing 
                and speech perception share this neural area, and thus there is direct correlation between musical ability 
                and aural functional memory - specifically literacy related skills. 
                Evidence from research indicates that learning musical skills changes brain structure in a way that 
                improves learning ability in general. In particular, reading music has shown increased brain function, 
                again indicated the shared brain function. 
                Reading music and reading text also shares a perception and encoding of visual symbols, subsequently 
                followed by a musical or verbal response. Similarly, both musical notation and letters do not resemble 
                their corresponding sounds.
                Another study found that those who had some ability in playing the piano and were able to sight-read 
                musical notation utilised areas of the brain that those who could not read music were not able to utilise. 
                Conversely, it could be argued that any new skill utilises areas of the brain that would otherwise not be 
                used.</p>

                (Fisher & McDonald, 2001; Hansen & Bernstorf, 2002)"</p>

            <p class="summary">Summary:</p>
            <p>Reading music and text share many learning and processing methods. Studies show that there is a correlation

                Those who are able to read and play music were found to have increased skill in language perception and 
                articulation, with transferrable reading abilities between music and text.
                Music is an effective motivator for children as it incites positive learning, particularly in the field
