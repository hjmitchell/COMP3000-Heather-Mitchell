### About
PianoStudio is a research-backed interactive full-stack web application, designed for use by piano teachers and students.
The main objective is to bridge the gap between formal lessons and at-home learning and practising, encouraging self-led learning 
through various tools and interactive games designed around pedagogy and phonics-based learning techniques.

PianoStudio solves issues surrounding students having inefficient practice routines or a lack of experience in meaningful regular practice.
There is also a noticeable gap in the market of free-to-use online piano practice platforms to use alongside formal tuition.
